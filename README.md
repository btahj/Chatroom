# Chatroom
I created a multi-paged client-side application that required Signup/Login before access to the chat. The project was mainly focused on getting myself familiar with web development, as this was my first ever time coding. 

# Technologies
`HTML, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, React`

# Description
This application was centered around the idea of a very simple chatroom, where a user has to sign up before gaining access to the chat itself. As well as login with their credentials. The user could then submit a "Post" that is reflected onto a list which you can then Update or Delete posts. However it is only client-side so there is no actual communication at this time.

## Challenges
Some challenges i faced early on in this project stemed from the fact that previously I had Zero expereince. I had a hard time getting the chatroom list to work in the way i wanted, still needs improving, as well as the CRUD functionallity.

## Successes
The main success i had was the fact i had actually created a page from scratch and it actually did stuff, which was a huge accomplishment at the time. Another success was implementing the Signup/Login pages, where you are required to sign-up before logging in and using the app.
